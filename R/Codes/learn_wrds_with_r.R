#' ## Querying the Data set Structure (Metadata)

#' When working with WRDS data, it is often useful to examine the structure of
#' the dataset, before focusing on the data itself. WRDS data is organized by
#' vendor (such as crsp) and referred to as a library. Each library contains a
#' number of database tables or datasets (such as dsf), which contain the actual
#' data in tabular format with column headers called variables.
#'
#' You can analyze the structure of the data through its metadata by querying the
#' information_schema table, as outlined in the following steps:
#'
#'  1. Select a library to work with, and list all available datasets within that
#'    library
#'
#'  2. Select a dataset, and list all available variables (column headers)
#'    within that dataset
#'
#' **NOTE**: When referencing library and dataset names, you must
#' use all lowercase. This applies to both **information_schema.tables** and
#' **information_schema.columns** files.

#+ query_wrds_metadata

# Determine the data libraries available at WRDS
res <- dbSendQuery(wrds, "select distinct table_schema
                   from information_schema.tables
                   where table_type ='VIEW'
                   or table_type ='FOREIGN TABLE'
                   order by table_schema")
wrds_libs <- dbFetch(res, n = -1)
dbClearResult(res)
head(wrds_libs)

# Determine the datasets within a given library:
res <- dbSendQuery(wrds, "select distinct table_name
                   from information_schema.columns
                   where table_schema='crsp'
                   order by table_name")
lib_tables <- dbFetch(res, n = -1)
dbClearResult(res)
head(lib_tables)

# Determine the variables (column headers) within a given dataset:
res <- dbSendQuery(wrds, "select column_name
                   from information_schema.columns
                   where table_schema='crsp'
                   and table_name='dsf'
                   order by column_name")

dbClearResult(res)

#' ## Query WRDS Data

#' Now that you've learned how to query the metadata and understand the structure
#' of the data, you are ready to query WRDS data directly. The dbSendQuery()
#' function can be used quite flexibly to pull WRDS data directly.
#'
#' Unlike metadata queries, data queries reference both the data library and its
#' constituent dataset together in dot notation. For example, a data query for
#' the dataset **dsf** within the library **crsp** would use the syntax **crsp.dsf**.
#'
#' **NOTE:** Unlike querying the PostgreSQL information_schema table, querying
#' database tables themselves (such as crsp.dsf) does not require that you adhere
#' to any specific case (i.e. upper- or lowercase). However, to keep things the
#' same across the board, WRDS recommends always using lowercase for referencing
#' libraries and their datasets.
